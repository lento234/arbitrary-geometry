Arbitrary Geometry
============

Similar evaluation as the problem of potential flow evaluation of single cylinder where the cylinder was defined using constant strength source panels.

Arbitrary geometry package, designed in object-oriented fashion. 

Files Include:
=============

- main.py  [main]

- arbitrary.py [calculation module]
	contains:
	- unitVec.py (coordinate transformation and unit vectors)
	- vort2D.py  (induced velocity from constant strength source panel, and point vortex)

- plotMod [plotting module] ???

External Modules:
- streamlines.py   (plotting the streamlines)
