Arbitrary Geometry
============

Similar evaluation as the problem of potential flow evaluation of single cylinder where the cylinder was defined using constant strength source panels.

Arbitrary geometry package, designed in object-oriented fashion. 

Files Include:
=============

- main.py  [main]
    call module:
        contains only scripts for initializing the problem

- multipleGeometry.py [calculation module]
	Main modules:
	    - sourceTerm:
	        calculate only the source term for the input problem. Saves the data
	        in an organized class called 'data'.
	        
	    - panelMethod:
	        calculates source term in necessary, and calculates the induced
	        velocities at the control points.Saves the data
	        in an organized class called 'data'.
	        
	    - inducedVelocities:
	        ??? (not written yet)
	        
    Other modules:
        - dataClass [class]: 
            creates an empty class, without attributes
            
        - Geometry [class]: 
            create a class with .x (x-axis) and .y (y-axis) data attributes
